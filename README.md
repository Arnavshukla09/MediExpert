# MediExpert
Medical Expert System is a lightweight Next.js + TypeScript application that provides an interactive symptom selector and a compact diagnosis engine (see diagnosis-engine.ts) to explore common diseases, their symptoms, descriptions, and suggested treatments—built for prototyping, education, and demos; not intended as medical advice.
